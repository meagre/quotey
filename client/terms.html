          <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <p class="lead">This website is provided as a public resource to share and promote the best in literary quotations. Qurious.cc welcomes members to contribute and collect their favourite quotations and interact with our online community.</p>

         <p class="body">Quotations must be contributed under the following guidelines:
         <ul>
         <li>members cannot submit their own works (unpublished or self-published) to Qurious.cc, no matter how earth-shattering. Qurious.cc aims to deliver premium literary quotations that have been widely published or quoted since the time of the Greeks and Romans.</li>
         <li>members cannot attribute their own works to literary masters, deceased or living, or any other author for that matter. Fraudulent, misattributed, or incorrect quotations will be removed without warning. We will find you.</li>
         <li>quotations are limited to a maximum of 1000 characters, not wordsâ€”that means, keep it short-form and powerful for best display and reading results.</li>
         <li>no links, spam, emoticons, html or javascript hacks will be approved for submission. </li>
         <li>check your spelling and that the quotation is correct. This is the easy part.</li>
         <li>all formals forms of English (e.g. American or British English) are acceptable on Qurious.cc. For quotations, it is best to use the variety of English in which the author originally wrote the text. For older texts, unleash your mind powers.</li>
